INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
UUID Features Menu module adds Features support for
menu items using UUIDs instead of default mlid identifier. Each menu item
receives UUID hash and can be transferred with Features without using mlids. 
For core entity types (Nodes, Users, Taxonomy) this module will export 
menu items paths like 'node/[UUID]' which will be translated into 
normal "node/[NID]" when enabling Feature on target instance.

REQUIREMENTS
------------ 
This module requires the following modules:  
* Core Menu module  
* Features (https://drupal.org/project/features)  
* UUID
(https://drupal.org/project/uuid)

INSTALLATION 
------------  
* Install as you would normally install a contributed
drupal module. See:  https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-
themes/modules-7 for further information.

CONFIGURATION 
------------- 
The module will add Features "Menu links (UUID)" component to the standard 
Features UI where you will be able to select menu itmes with UUID support you 
would like to export with your Feature.

NOTE: Because of Postgres doesn't currently have built-in UUID functions
you have to be attentive during the process of generating of UUIDs for
menu links.

Drush integration isn't implemented yet.
