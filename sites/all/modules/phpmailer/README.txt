-- REQUIREMENTS --

* Access to an SMTP server

* Libraries API module
  http://drupal.org/project/libraries

* PHPMailer library
  https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer

Optional:

* To connect to an SMTP server using SSL, your PHP installation needs to have
  OpenSSL support.

* Mime Mail module to send HTML e-mails
  http://drupal.org/project/mimemail

* Personalized E-mails module to adjust the displayed sender name
  http://drupal.org/project/pmail


-- INSTALLATION --

1. Download the latest PHPMailer library from

     https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tags

   and extract the following files into a 'phpmailer' library directory:

     sites/all/libraries/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php
     sites/all/libraries/phpmailer/class.smtp.php

   It is recommended that you create your libraries directory at one of the
   following locations:

     sites/all/libraries/phpmailer
     sites/<site>/libraries/phpmailer

   Consult the Libraries API documentation for further information.

2. Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* Configure user permissions at Administer >> User management >> Access
  control >> phpmailer module.

  Only users with the "administer phpmailer settings" permission are allowed to
  access the module configuration page.

* Configure your SMTP server settings at Administer >> Site
  configuration >> PHPMailer.

  If used in conjunction with Mime Mail, PHPMailer will show up as an e-mail
  engine in the Mime Mail module settings.  To let Mime Mail apply styles and
  formatting to system e-mails but still use PHPMailer for mail transport,
  uncheck "Use PHPMailer to send e-mails" first on the PHPMailer settings
  page.  Then activate "Use mime mail for all messages" on the Mime Mail
  settings page and choose PHPMailer from the list of available e-mail engines.

* Using Google Mail or Google Apps as SMTP server

  To send e-mails with Google Mail use the following settings:

    SMTP server:     smtp.gmail.com
    SMTP port:       465
    Secure protocol: SSL
    Username:        your_google_mail_name@gmail.com
      or:            your_username@your_google_apps_domain.com
    Password:        your_google_mail_password

  In Advanced SMTP settings:
    Enable 'Always set "Reply-To" address' checkbox.

  Also note the sending limits for Google Mail accounts:

* Using other popular freemailers as SMTP server

  See http://phpmailer.worxware.com/index.php?pg=tip_srvrs.

* Errors when trying to send a test email

  If you see the following error messages when trying to send a test email from
  the settings page:

    SMTP -> ERROR: Failed to connect to server: Connection timed out (110)
    SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host. 

  it means the mail server can not be reached, usually because your hosting
  provider is blocking the port by a firewall. The solution is to ask your
  provider to allow outgoing connections to your mail server.

* Debug settings

  PHPMailer supports rerouting all e-mails for debugging purposes, to prevent
  you from accidentally sending out e-mails to real users from a development
  site.  To enable this feature, add the following lines to the end of your
  settings.php (usually located in sites/default):

    $conf['phpmailer_debug_email'] = 'your_debug_email@yoursite.com';

  This will change the recipient of all e-mails to the configured address.
